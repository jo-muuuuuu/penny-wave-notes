## Project Setup
### Define Root State and Dispatch Types
Using `configureStore` should not need any additional typings. You will, however, want to extract the `RootState` type and the `Dispatch` type so that they can be referenced as needed. Inferring these types from the store itself means that they correctly update as you add more state slices or modify middleware settings.

Since those are types, it's safe to export them directly from your store setup file such as `app/store.ts` and import them directly into other files.
```
import { configureStore } from '@reduxjs/toolkit'
// ...

export const store = configureStore({
  reducer: {
    posts: postsReducer,
    comments: commentsReducer,
    users: usersReducer,
  },
})

// Infer the `RootState` and `AppDispatch` types from the store itself
export type RootState = ReturnType<typeof store.getState>
// Inferred type: {posts: PostsState, comments: CommentsState, users: UsersState}
export type AppDispatch = typeof store.dispatch
```

### Define Typed Hooks
While it's possible to import the `RootState` and `AppDispatch` types into each component, it's better to create typed versions of the `useDispatch` and `useSelector` hooks for usage in your application. This is important for a couple reasons:

For `useSelector`, it saves you the need to type `(state: RootState)` every time

For `useDispatch`, the default `Dispatch` type does not know about thunks. In order to correctly dispatch thunks, you need to use the specific customized `AppDispatch` type from the store that includes the thunk middleware types, and use that with `useDispatch`. Adding a pre-typed useDispatch hook keeps you from forgetting to import `AppDispatch` where it's needed.

Since these are actual variables, not types, it's important to define them in a separate file such as `app/hooks.ts`, not the store setup file. This allows you to import them into any component file that needs to use the hooks, and avoids potential circular import dependency issues.
```
import { useDispatch, useSelector } from 'react-redux'
import type { RootState, AppDispatch } from './store'

// Use throughout your app instead of plain `useDispatch` and `useSelector`
export const useAppDispatch = useDispatch.withTypes<AppDispatch>()
export const useAppSelector = useSelector.withTypes<RootState>()
```

## Application Usage
### Define Slice State and Action Types
Each slice file should define a type for its initial state value, so that `createSlice` can correctly infer the type of `state` in each case reducer.

All generated actions should be defined using the `PayloadAction<T>` type from Redux Toolkit, which takes the type of the `action.payload` field as its generic argument.

You can safely import the `RootState` type from the store file here. It's a circular import, but the TypeScript compiler can correctly handle that for types. This may be needed for use cases like writing selector functions.
```
import { createSlice } from '@reduxjs/toolkit'
import type { PayloadAction } from '@reduxjs/toolkit'
import type { RootState } from '../../app/store'

// Define a type for the slice state
interface CounterState {
  value: number
}

// Define the initial state using that type
const initialState: CounterState = {
  value: 0,
}

export const counterSlice = createSlice({
  name: 'counter',
  // `createSlice` will infer the state type from the `initialState` argument
  initialState,
  reducers: {
    increment: (state) => {
      state.value += 1
    },
    decrement: (state) => {
      state.value -= 1
    },
    // Use the PayloadAction type to declare the contents of `action.payload`
    incrementByAmount: (state, action: PayloadAction<number>) => {
      state.value += action.payload
    },
  },
})

export const { increment, decrement, incrementByAmount } = counterSlice.actions

// Other code such as selectors can use the imported `RootState` type
export const selectCount = (state: RootState) => state.counter.value

export default counterSlice.reducer
```

The generated action creators will be correctly typed to accept a `payload` argument based on the `PayloadAction<T>` type you provided for the reducer. For example, `incrementByAmount` requires a `number` as its argument.

### Use Typed Hooks in Components
In component files, import the pre-typed hooks instead of the standard hooks from React-Redux.

```
import React, { useState } from 'react'

import { useAppSelector, useAppDispatch } from 'app/hooks'

import { decrement, increment } from './counterSlice'

export function Counter() {
  // The `state` arg is correctly typed as `RootState` already
  const count = useAppSelector((state) => state.counter.value)
  const dispatch = useAppDispatch()

  // omit rendering logic
}
```
